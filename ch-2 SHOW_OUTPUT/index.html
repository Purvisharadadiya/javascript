            <h2> what is javascript</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a programming language used to make websites interactive. It runs in web browsers and helps with tasks like showing animations, updating web pages without reloading, and handling user actions like clicks or typing.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>JavaScript is a free, open-source scripting language used for web development.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            JavaScript is OOP(Object Oriented Programming) based Client Side Language.
        </li>
        <li>
            JavaScript is Loosely Coupled Language and Weakly Typed Language and Case Sensitive Language.
        </li>
        <li>
            JavaScript is not a compiled language, but it is a translated language. The JavaScript Translator (embedded in the browser) is responsible for translating the JavaScript code for the web browser.
        </li>
        <li>JavaScript has no connectivity with Java programming language.</li>
        <li>In addition to web browser, databases such as CouchDB and MongoDB uses JavaScript as their scripting and query language.</li>

            <h1>History of JavaScript
            </h1>
            <h3>1. Creation (1995):</h3>
            <p>JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in just 10 days while he was working at Netscape Communications Corporation. Initially named Mocha, it was later renamed to LiveScript and finally to JavaScript to align with the popularity of Java at the time, even though the two languages are not related.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>2. Purpose:
            </h3>
            <p>JavaScript was designed to make web pages dynamic and interactive, allowing browsers to execute small scripts directly on web pages.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>3. Standardization (1997):</h3>
            <p>JavaScript was submitted to ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association) International, which led to the creation of the ECMAScript standard. The first official version, ECMAScript 1, was released to ensure consistency across different browsers.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>It has a lower performance as compared to ES6.
                Uses var to declare variables.
                Functions are written using the function keyword.
                String concatenation is done using +.
                Classes are created using constructor functions and prototypes.
                Default values are manually set.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>ES6</h3>

                Introduced let and const for block-scoped variables.
                Introduced arrow functions for shorter syntax and automatic this binding.
                Introduced template literals using backticks `` for easier string interpolation.
                Introduced the class syntax for a cleaner and more readable approach.
                Default parameters are supported natively.
